### Who I am ? 

I'm a software engineer and entreprener. 
I've created my first company during 2015, to create open-source softwares for the French cities and government, to help citizens express themselves about official projects of their cities. 
I've created a second company during 2017, to create a platform to help restaurants to find the best products (and best prices !) on a single marketplace.

I've been a teacher in multiple schools during 3 years.

### Languages and technos ðŸ’™

For all projects :
- Javascript and Typescript (of course !)
- RedwoodJS
- MeteorJS
- GraphQL

For the back :
- Express
- NodeJS / Bun
- Bash / Shell scripts
- Docker
- SQL / Mongo

Just for the front :
- React
- Angular
- Pure HTML and CSS
- TailwindCSS and other CSS libraries / frameworks

### Would you take some project management ?

Because technologies are not 100% of a project, I put a lot of attention about project design and management.
With my experience, I've managed dozens of projects, as a technical director, CTO, or just project manager. 

If you need some advices, don't hesitate to ask ðŸ™‚
